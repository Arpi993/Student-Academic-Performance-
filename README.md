# Student-Academic-Performance-
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize student academic performance data. The project aims to provide insights into factors that affect student performance, identify trends in student performance over time, and provide actionable recommendations to improve academic outcomes.

# Technologies Used:
This project is written in Python 3 and uses the Pandas library for data analysis, as well as Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

# Instructions to Run:
* Download the project files and save them in a folder.
* Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the folder containing the project files.
* Run the following command to execute the program: python Algorithm1.py
* The program will prompt the user to input the student's academic data.
* After inputting the data, the program will calculate the target variables and save the data to a CSV file.
# Structure of the project:
The project has one file named Algorithm1.py. The program contains a function that calculates the target variables based on the student's academic data.

# Features of the project:
* Calculates dropout rate based on the minimum semester grade and attendance percentage.
* Identifies students who require additional support based on the presence of grades between 40 and 60.
* Determines eligibility for placement based on the minimum semester grade and the presence of extracurricular activities, academic awards, or coding skills.
### Examples:
Here's an example of how to input the data and the resulting CSV file:

**Input:**
a = 65, b = 75, c = 85, d = 80, e = 70, f = 90, g = 80, h = 1, i = 1, j = 0
**Output (CSV file):**
| Dropout  | Good Performance | Poor Performance | Support Required | Eligible for Placement |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| 0 | 1  |  0 |  1	|	1   |
* Data cleaning and preprocessing: the project cleans and preprocesses the raw student performance data to prepare it for analysis
* Data visualization: the project creates various visualizations (e.g., scatterplots, histograms, heatmaps) to help visualize patterns and trends in the data
* Correlation analysis: the project calculates correlation coefficients between different variables to identify relationships between factors and student performance
* Predictive modeling: the project uses machine learning techniques (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) to build models to predict student performance based on different factors
* Actionable recommendations: the project provides actionable recommendations based on the insights generated from the analysis and modeling

# Contributions:
The project is a solo assignment.
